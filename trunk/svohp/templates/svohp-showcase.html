    <h2><a href="{% url svohp-main %}">Shenandoah Valley Oral History Project</a></h2>
    Initiated by the JMU History Department, the project seeks to bridge the gap between
    the university and the surrounding community. While students gather interviews and
    learn from neighborhood residents, the website seeks to provide narrators as well
    as a broad-based audience with ready access to these materials.
